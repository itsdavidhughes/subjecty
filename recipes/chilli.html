<h1>Chilli</h1>
	<p>This makes enough chilli for 3 people for 2 meals each. After eating it for dinner it makes a great lunch and the leftovers are versatile enough to be eaten with a baked potato, in tacos, wraps or on top of sweet potato chips.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>

	<ul>
	<li>Any type of cooking oil</li>
	<li>500grams of lean mince/quorn</li>
	<li>1 large onion</li>
	<li>4 garlic cloves</li>
	<li>1 Red Pepper</li>
	<li>Half a pack of chestnut mushrooms</li>
	<li><p>Bar of dark chocolate</p></li>
	<li><p>Beef stock</p></li>
	<li>2 tins of chopped tomatoes</li>
	<li>2 tin of mixed beans in chilli sauce</li>
	<li><p>Tomato purée with chilli</p></li>
	<li><p>1 heaped tblsp Hot chilli mix/hot chilli powder</p></li>
	<li>1 tblsp Cumin</li>
	<li>1 heaped tblsp Smoked paprika</li>
	<li><p>1 tsp Dried chilli flakes</p></li>
	<li><p>Mature cheddar cheese</p></li>
	<li>Greek yogurt</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Prep</h2>

	<p>Dice onion as small as you can</p>

	<p>Roughly chop the garlic small</p>

	<p>Roughly dice your red pepper</p>

	<p>Cut mushrooms whatever way you like them</p>

	<p>Dissolve beef stock in a mug of boiling water</p>

	<h2>Start cooking</h2>

	<p>Get a big pot with a lid and pour loads of oil in so that it more than covers the base. Turn the heat up medium to high.</p>

	<h3>The base</h3>

	<p>This is the most important part of the chilli. Once your oil heats up, chuck in your onions — they should start frying immediately.</p>

	<p>Stir fry those bad boys for about 4 minutes or until they go translucent.</p>

	<p>Toss in your garlic and stir fry for another 2-3 minutes until you can smell it.</p>

	<p>Throw in all your spices and continue to stir fry. You should start to see and smell a lovely base for the overall chilli forming.</p>

	<p>Turn the heat down to medium - just don't let the spices stick to the pot. That's all your flavour ffs. The base should look dark, red, oily and delicious.</p>

	<p>If it's looking a bit dry or sticky, it's probably because the powdered spices are absorbing the oil or the heat is up too high. Just add a little more oil and keep stirring to manage the heat.</p>

	<p>Add your mushrooms and diced pepper and fry for about 5 more minutes so they absorb some of that flavour.</p>

	<h3>Mince</h3>

	<p>If your base is looking good and not sticking — crumble in your meat/quorn and turn the heat up high.</p>

	<p>If you're using beef, you want to brown/seal the mince so there are no more pink bits. You'll need to smash it up with a wooden spoon in parts probably - don't want any meatballs forming.</p>

	<p>Once the meat is browned, pour in the beef stock and bring it to the boil.</p>

	<h3>Sauce</h3>

	<p>Keep the heat on high, then pour in your 2 tins of tomatoes and about 2 tablespoons of tomato purée.</p>

	<p>Mix it all about and bring to the boil. It should start to look a bit like a chilli now.</p>

	<p>Put the lid on, turn the heat down and simmer for 15 minutes. Check it halfway through and make sure it's not sticking to the pot.</p>

	<p>Once the 15 minutes are up, add your 2 tins of beans and bring to the boil again.</p>

	<p>Once boiling, melt in the chocolate and stir. The colour should get slightly darker at this point. Less like a bolognese — more like a Mexican chilli. Turn the heat down to medium.</p>

	<p>Cook on medium with the lid off for a further 15 minutes until you can smell the chocolate cooking.</p>

	<h3>Let it rest</h3>

	<p>I know you're probably starving, but this is really important. Rest your chilli off the heat, with no lid on — for <em>at least</em> 15 minutes.</p>

	<h3>Toppings</h3>

	<p>Take your mind off how hungry you are by grating your cheese and getting your yogurt ready.</p>

	<p>Once it's rested, put your chilli in a bowl, add a tablespoon of yogurt and a handful of cheese.</p>
